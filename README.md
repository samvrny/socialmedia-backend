# Social Media Back-End

## Description
This project is a back end API for a hypothetical social media site build using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and dayjs for date formatting. 

## Installation 
This app uses the mongoose, express, and dayjs packages. Run npm install from the command line to install the required depenancies.

## Usage
Run npm start from the command line to start the server once the dependancies are installed. This application has no front end, so you will need to use a tool like Insomnia to test the routes in this application. Examples of the routes can be found in the demonstration video below, and the routes are located in the routes/api directory for reference.
